# Track Suggester
#### A helpful tool in deciding which coding language to learn, 06/02/17
#### By Larry Taylor

## Description

This is a simple tool to help decide between three possible language tracks at Epicodus. Through the user input via select boxes, a suggestion for the best track will be revealed.

## Running instructions
* Pull https://github.com/ltmoocow14/track-suggester.git.
* Piew index.html, and see javascript and css in corresponding folders.
* Piew page on gh-pages at https://ltmoocow14.github.io/track-suggester/

## Known Bugs/Problems

* Does not include responsive language, so this is best seen on a full screen
* As of now, there is only one combination of input selectors that will result in a response of ruby/rails or java/android. All other combinations direct to CSS/Design. I'm working on figuring out how to get multiple options.
